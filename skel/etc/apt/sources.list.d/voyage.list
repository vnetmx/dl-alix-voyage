# By default we don't use  Voyage's "Experimental" APT repository. Many 
# of its packages are from Debian Testing anyway.
# Make sure you import its key before you activate it:
#
#     wget http://www.voyage.hk/dists/experimental/archive.key -O - | apt-key add - 
#
#deb http://mirror.voyage.hk/dists/experimental  ./
