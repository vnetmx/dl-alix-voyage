TODO soon:
 * Make the deploy-alix-voyage-chroot variable DONT_DISABLE_SERIAL 
   (and possibly others) configurable in deploy-alix-voyage.conf
 * Add "enable|disable" option to all our init scripts and call that
 * Make "$initscript enable" smart to distinguish 'default' and 'legacy' mode
 * Re-enable 'default' startup (Possibly without concurrency?)
 * Think about the best place to activate LED blinking during boot/shutdown
 * Try 'remountro' regularly via cron
 * sync_clock 'start' at bootup different from called by cron: produces output
 * Consider to uninstall Debian live packages


TODO later:
 * Automagically don't 'prepare_serial' for ttys with inittab gettys
 * Nagios-monitor RW/RO
 * More dynamic motd (current debian version)
 * /var/log on /data? (See voyage-sync 'mount back')


TODO DLBI:
 * Split off re-write dirs (state, logs) from /opt to /data
 * Make /opt read-only (But: hwo to .pyc files get created?)


DONE:
 * Enable getty on ttyS1/COM2
 * Fixed shutdown in legacy SysVinit mode so all daemons get stopped gracefully
 * Fixed /etc/cron.daily/{apt,dpkg,passwd} that want to write to /
 * Speed up SSH
 * Mail after each reboot
 * Moved /home into RW /data partition
 * update .conf sample file
 * Dont configure COM1 serial when DONT_DISABLE_SERIAL=yes
 * Re-ordered legacy startup order
 * Re-enabled shutdown LEDs in legacy mode
 * Create partitions /opt/ and /data/
 * Test whether CF is mounted
 * Allow if's to become active later
 * Add verbosity
 * Fix apt-get error "WARNING: The following packages cannot be authenticated!"
 * postfix deals with read-only
 * Make sync_clock timestamp work with read-only /
 * Make hwclock's /etc/adjtime work with read-only /
 * Boot delay 1sec
 * Better MOTD banner
